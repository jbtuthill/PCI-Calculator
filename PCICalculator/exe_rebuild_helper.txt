# Rebuilding PCICalculator.exe after modifying PCICalculator.py

1. Open Command Prompt and go to the PCICalculator folder:
   cd C:\Users\MSIUser\Documents\GitHub\PCI-Calculator\PCICalculator

2. Make sure PyInstaller is installed:
   pip install pyinstaller

3. Build the exe (bundles PCI_ACP_Calculator.xlsx with the program):
   pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "PCI_ACP_Calculator.xlsx;." PCICalculator.py

4. The new exe will be created in:
   C:\Users\MSIUser\Documents\GitHub\PCI-Calculator\PCICalculator\dist\PCICalculator.exe

5. To run:
   - Double-click PCICalculator.exe, OR
   - Run from command line: PCICalculator.exe
   - Select your CSV file when prompted.

Notes:
- If you change the way the Excel file is loaded, make sure to use `sys._MEIPASS` so it works both in .py and .exe form.
- Alternatively, copy `PCI_ACP_Calculator.xlsx` into the dist folder manually if not bundling.
